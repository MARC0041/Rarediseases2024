The classic form of CCD is characterized by delayed closure of the fontanels,\\nhypoplastic or aplastic clavicles and dental anomalies. Clinical reports suggest that a subset of\\npatients with CCD have skeletal changes which mimic hypophosphatasia. Mutations in RUNX2\\nare detected in approximately 65% of cases of CCD, and microdeletions occur in 13%. We present\\nclinical and radiological features in a 6-year-old child with severe CCD manifested by absence of\\nthe clavicles marked calvarial hypomineralization, osteoporosis and progressive kyphoscoliosis.\\nHypophosphatasia features included Bowdler spurs, severe osteopenia and low alkaline\\nphosphatase. Following negative mutation analysis of RUNX2 , comparative genomic hybridization\\n(CGH) microarray was performed. The result revealed a microdeletion in RUNX2 , disrupting the\\nC-terminal part of the gene.\\nKeywords\\ncleidocranial dysplasia; hypophosphatasia; RUNX2 ; osteoporosis; kyphoscoliosis; aCGH;\\nmicrodeletion; C-terminus\\nINTRODUCTION\\nCleidocranial dysplasia (CCD; OMIM 119600) and hypophosphatasia (HPP; OMIM\\n241500) are two distinct skeletal disorders. CCD is an autosomal dominant disorder caused\\nby haploinsufficiency of RUNX2  “Runt related transcription factor 2”. [Mundlos et al, 1995;\\nMundlos 1997; Lee et al., 1997]. RUNX2  is a transcription factor essential for osteoblast cell\\ncommitment and chondrocyte maturation [Ducy et al, 1997].\\nDelayed closure of the fontanels, hypoplastic or aplastic clavicles and dental anomalies\\ncharacterize CCD. Inter and intra-familial variable expressivity [Chitayat et al., 1992] range\\nfrom a mild isolated dental phenotype to severe CCD complicated by recurrent fractures and\\ngeneralized osteoporosis [Quack et al.,1999].

       " 'are consistent features of this disorder [Otto et al., 2002; Quack et al., 1999]. Craniofacial\\nfeatures include brachycephaly, delayed closure of the fontanelles and sutures, wormian\\nbones, frontal and biparietal bossing, relative macrocephaly, depressed nasal bridge, midface\\nhypoplasia, unerupted teeth with supernumerary permanent teeth and delayed union of the\\nmandibular symphysis. Other skeletal features include short stature (mild to moderate), genu\\nvalgum, delayed ossification of the pubic symphysis and pubic bones, tall/ hypoplastic iliac\\nwings, pes planus, brachydactyly, joint laxity and scoliosis, [Cooper et al., 2001;Mendoza-\\nLondono and Lee, 2006]. Debilitating kyphoscoliosis is not common in CCD. Scoliosis was\\nreported in 16/90 (17%) of patients with CCD, usually manifesting at a later age. Three of\\nthe affected patients in that study used a back brace, and none required surgery [Cooper et\\nal, 2001].\\nHypophosphatasia is an inborn error of bone metabolism caused by mutations in the tissue\\nnon-specific alkaline phosphatase ( TNSALP ) gene [Whyte, 1994]. Both autosomal recessive\\nand dominant forms have been described. Clinical manifestations of hypophosphatasia vary\\nby age at clinical presentation and are divided into: perinatal, childhood, adult forms, as well\\nas odontohypophosphatasia where only dental manifestations are noted. The level of serum\\nalkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity seems to be correlated with the severity of the disorder\\n[Whyte, 1994].\\nBiochemical markers used for the diagnosis of HPP include low serum alkaline phosphatase,\\nincreased phosphoethanolamine (PEA) in urine and plasma, increased inorganic plasma\\npyrophosphate (PPi) and increased pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP) in absence of vitamin B6\\nintake [Whyte 1994; Whyte 2001]. The term “severe CCD” has been used to describe\\npatients who have CCD, osteoporosis and early recurrent fractures [Quack et al., 1999], and\\nsevere parietal bone hypoplasia [Cunningham et al., 2006]. In 2002, two separate groups\\ndescribed patients who had combined features of CCD and HPP. One group found no\\nmutations in RUNX2  or TNSALP [Unger et al., 2002], while the other reported a\\nheterozygous mutation (Arg169Pro caused by nucleotide change 506G>C) in RUNX2  in a\\nmother and daughter [Morava et al., 2002]. A CCD-Like phenotype has also been reported\\nwith 8q22 deletions [Breuten et. al, 1992]. We describe herein the clinical- radiologic and\\ngenetic-metabolic findings of a child with severe CCD featuring short stature, osteoporosis\\nand progressive kyphoscoliosis. He also had Bowdler spurs, and subnormal serum alkaline\\nphosphatase levels suggestive of HPP. The underlying genetic defect was found to be a\\nmicrodeletion in the C-terminal region of RUNX2 .\\nCLINICAL REPORT\\nA 6-year-old male, with normal intellect, was referred to the skeletal dysplasia clinic\\nbecause of CCD complicated by severe progressive kyphoscoliosis. His prenatal history and\\nultrasound were normal. He is the only child, born to a young, nonconsanguineous\\nCaucasian couple. The father is 196 cm and the mother 163 cm. Delivery was by cesarean at\\n41 weeks gestation due to cephalo-pelvic disproportion. At birth, his weight was 3.65 kg,\\nlength 50.8 cm, and head circumference 35 cm.\\nHe was noted to have a soft cranium and narrow, sloping shoulders. The chest wall was not\\nsmall or deformed. He had peripheral cyanosis and mild tachypnea that resolved by hood O2\\nas well as hypoglycemia that resolved by feeding. The family history revealed that the\\nproband’s parents were healthy and a distant maternal male cousin had short stature and\\nthyroid disease.\\nThe patient had widened fontanels and relative macrocephaly. Progressive growth failure\\nbegan at 3 months of age. A full endocrine and gastrointestinal work up revealed no\\nexplanation for his growth failure.

He had recurrent otitis media, requiring grommet tube insertions, and\\ndeveloped profound hearing loss-requiring hearing aids. He also had chronic sinusitis and\\nwheezing episodes. Kyphoscoliosis was apparent before 1 year of age, requiring a back\\nbrace at the age of 3 years, with no improvement. Figure 1, demonstrates the severity of his\\nbone deformity at the age of 7 years.\\nHis past history was significant for 2 separate fractures following minor trauma: a posterior\\ncortical fracture of the distal tibia which required casting for 2 weeks and a hairline fracture\\nof the foot. He also required frenuloplasty for ankyloglossia, adenoidectomy and inguinal\\nhernia repair. He had nasalized speech which was otherwise normal. He had short trunked\\ndwarfism and was approximately 4 standard deviations (SD) below the mean for height, and\\n2 SD below the mean for weight. He had brachycephaly and frontal bossing. The anterior\\nand posterior fontanels, as well as the metopic suture were wide open. He had hypertelorism\\nand slight depression of his nasal bridge. His palate was narrow and high arched. He had\\nsupernumerary teeth, while other teeth were missing. His shoulders were narrow, sloping,\\nand could be opposed easily. The back and spine showed severe kyphoscoliosis. The chest\\nwall was asymmetrically deformed, protruding anteriorly at the upper part of the sternum.\\nThe cardiopulmonary exam was normal. The abdominal exam showed no organomegaly, the\\ngenitourinary exam was unremarkable. He had brachydactyly, with broad, proximally-\\nplaced thumbs.\\nThere was swelling at the middle inter-phalangeal joints and laxity of the joints of the\\nfingers, wrists, and elbows. There were bilateral skin dimples in the region of the mid shaft\\nof the tibiae, and pes planus. The neurological exam was essentially normal with no\\nevidence of nerve compression. The radiological findings are demonstrated in Figure 2 and\\nFigure 3 respectively, taken during the first week of life. A prominent finding was\\ngeneralized osteopenia. The skull was brachycephalic with markedly diminished ossification\\nof membranous bone, wide separation of the sutures, wormian bones and hypoplastic teeth.\\nThe clavicles were absent bilaterally and the posterior ribs were widely separated from the\\nspinal elements. There were coronal and sagittal cleft- like ossification defects in the lumbar\\nvertebrae, and kyphoscoliosis with lumbar lordosis. There was absent ossification of the\\npubic and ischial bones. The hands revealed hypoplastic metacarpals and distal phalanges of\\nthe thumbs. Both fibulae showed osteochondral projections (Bowdler spurs) at the midshaft\\nof the fibulae, but the long bones revealed no evidence of metaphyseal abnormalities. The\\npatient’s most recent pulmonary function testing was restricted by his severe kyphoscoliosis.\\nHis maximum inspiratory and expiratory pressures were low at 16% of predicted for\\nmaximum inspiratory pressure and 36% of predicted for maximum expiratory pressure.\\nBone mineral density done at the age of 7 years revealed severe demineralization of the\\nlumbar spine corresponding to a calculated z-score of −3.4 and z- score average of both\\nfemoral necks was −4.87.\\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\\nBiochemical studies revealed a serum calcium level of 9.9 mg/dl (8.7–10.5), with normal\\nalbumin and phosphorus levels. The serum alkaline phosphatase levels were low on two\\noccasions 102 U/L in 2007 (134–346) and 118 (145–320 U/L) in 2005.\\nHis urine spot phosphoethanolamine was 108mmol/mg creatinine, (within the normal range)\\nwhile the osteocalcin level was 8 ng/ml( normal <7.2).

       " \"using almost 5000 Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) clones was used to explore DNA\\ngains or losses in a peripheral blood specimen from this patient. Loss of a single BAC signal\\nwas reported at chromosome 6p12.3 (CTD-2528C1; 45,544,848-45,692bp). This deletion\\nwas confirmed and narrowed to ~70kb (45,593,804-45,643,200bp, +/ − 9kb for each nearest\\nproximal and distal flanking probes) using an oligonucleotide aCGH approach where seven\\ncontiguous oligonucleotide probes were lost.\\nThe magnitude of fluorescence lost was equivalent to a single copy deletion using either\\naCGH approach. The deletion disrupts the 3' end of the RUNX2  gene (OMIM #600211),\\nincluding an additional 25Kb of non-coding sequence past the stop codon (Fig. 4). This\\ndeletion is predicted to truncate the transcript and prevent translation of acids 327 to 521. No\\ndeletion, or alteration, was observed at 8q22, a region when deleted causes a CCD-like\\nphenotype [Brueton et al, 1992].\\nDISCUSSION\\nThe diagnosis of CCD is usually based on clinical and radiological findings [Lee and Zhou,\\n2004]. A subset of patients with CCD have radiographic and biochemical features that\\noverlap with HPP [Wyckoff et al., 2005; Morava et al., 2002; and Unger et al., 2002]. In\\ninfancy, it may be difficult to clinically differentiate between both disorders because both\\npresent with a soft cranium. RUNX2 , the gene mutated in CCD is a transcription factor that\\nregulates intra-membranous and endochondral ossification during embryonic and postnatal\\nskeletogenesis [Ducy et al., 1997]. Because the clavicles ossify embryologically by both\\nroutes, the presence of significantly hypoplastic or aplastic clavicle(s) suggest CCD [Zeng et\\nal., 2005; Huang et al., 1997]. Complete absence of the clavicle has not been reported in\\nHPP [Shohat et al., 1991]. Currently, there is no effective treatment for either disorder, but\\nfor purposes of genetic counseling and assessment of the prognosis, it is prudent to identify\\nthe underlying genetic/metabolic defect in patients with overlapping features.\\nIn this report, the proband had clinical features suggestive of CCD since birth. Unexplained\\nsevere growth failure, dentition problems, and progressive kyphoscoliosis started in infancy\\nproceeding into childhood. At the age of six years, he became a candidate for corrective\\nspinal surgery to prevent pulmonary restriction. The pulmonologist and multiple orthopedic\\nsurgeons suggested intervention to allow pulmonary expansion by either using a growing\\nrod or vertical expandable titanium rib (VEPTR). The decision to perform this surgery\\nelectively has been delayed due to concerns regarding the skeletal architecture and defective\\nbone mineralization. Absence of the clavicles, suggested a diagnosis of CCD. Quack et al\\n[1999] described a patient who had an unusual form of CCD, associated with an insertion/\\nframeshift mutation (1205–1206insC). This patient had recurrent fractures that started in\\nutero and severe osteoporosis diagnosed in adulthood. He developed severe scoliosis and\\nlordosis of the spine at a later age necessitating the implantation of a Harrington rod for\\nspinal support [Quack et al., 1999].\\nIt has been shown that Runx2  null mice ( −/−) do not form bone, and lose markers of early\\nbone differentiation including alkaline phosphatase while heterozygote Runx2  deficient mice\\n(+/−) have features of CCD with reduced alkaline phosphatase activity [Komori et al., 1997;\\nOtto et al.,1997]. Forced expression of RUNX2  in cell lines of mesenchymal origin lead to\\nupregulation of osteoblast-expressed genes such as osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase\\n[Ducy, 1999]. Mutant mice expressing a truncated Runx 2  C-protein lack a mineralized\\nskeleton and fail to transactivate the osteocalcin promoter when co expressed with either\\nBMP2  “ bone morphogenic protein 2” or TGFB  “ transforming growth factor beta”\\nresponsive [Afzal et al., 2005; Choi et al., 2001].El-Gharbawy et al.

       " \"In humans with CCD, RUNX2  mutations are detected in 65% of cases, while microdeletions\\noccur in 13% of those with normal mutation analysis [Mendoza-Londono and Lee, 2006].\\nMost deletions of RUNX2  involve only a few bases [Mundlos et al. 1995,1997; Otto et al.,\\n2002; Quack et al., 1999]. A larger deletion spanning both RUNX2  and the upstream gene\\nVEGF  “vascular endothelial growth factor” was detected in a patient with CCD and vascular\\nanomalies [Izumi et al., 2006]. Another report described a large intragenic deletion\\ninvolving exons 2–6 in a three-generation family with typical CCD features, hypoplastic\\ndistal phalanges and cone shaped epiphysis of the middle phalanges [Lee et al., 2008]. In our\\npatient, no mutations (base changes or small insertions/deletions) were detected upon\\nsequencing RUNX2 , so the possibility of a large-scale genomic change involving RUNX2\\nwas investigated using aCGH. These studies revealed a 50–70Kb deletion, which predicted a\\ndisruption of the C-terminal region of RUNX2  encompassing the coding sequence for amino\\nacids (aa) 327 to 521. SMAD 1,2,3,5 binding sites and the nuclear matrix targeting signal\\n(NMTS) regions are within the deleted region (aa 369–417 and aa 390–427, respectively;\\nwhile the RUNT domain is not. A similar mutation was described by Quack et al. [1999] in\\na patient with severe CCD. They reported an insertion/frameshift 3' of the RUNT domain,\\nwhich left the DNA binding domain intact, but without activation potential, and they\\npostulated that this alteration may result in a dominant negative effect [Quack et al. 1999].\\nWithin the constraints of the current clinical study, we cannot discriminate a dominant\\nnegative effect from haploinsufficiency. The hypophosphatasia features in our patient may\\nbe secondary to reduced osteoblast differentiation and bone formation or abnormal RUNX2 -\\nSMAD interaction. The findings in this patient emphasize the importance of defining the\\nclinical and metabolic phenotype in patients with severe disease and the need to search for\\ndeletions when sequencing of the target gene is normal. It also sheds light on the integral\\nrole of the C-terminal region of RUNX2  in human osteogenesis and osteoblast\\ndifferentiation.\\nAcknowledgments\\nThis work is supported in part by an NIH Program Project Grant HD22657\\nThe authors acknowledge the patient and his family for their kind participation in this case study.\\nREFERENCES\\nAfzal F, Pratap J, Ito K, Ito Y, Stein JL, van Wijnen AJ, Stein GS, Lian JB, Javed A.

CCD is an autosomal dominant disorder caused\\nby haploinsufficiency of RUNX2  “Runt related transcription factor 2”. [Mundlos et al, 1995;\\nMundlos 1997; Lee et al., 1997].

       " 'are consistent features of this disorder [Otto et al., 2002; Quack et al., 1999]. Craniofacial\\nfeatures include brachycephaly, delayed closure of the fontanelles and sutures, wormian\\nbones, frontal and biparietal bossing, relative macrocephaly, depressed nasal bridge, midface\\nhypoplasia, unerupted teeth with supernumerary permanent teeth and delayed union of the\\nmandibular symphysis. Other skeletal features include short stature (mild to moderate), genu\\nvalgum, delayed ossification of the pubic symphysis and pubic bones, tall/ hypoplastic iliac\\nwings, pes planus, brachydactyly, joint laxity and scoliosis, [Cooper et al., 2001;Mendoza-\\nLondono and Lee, 2006]. Debilitating kyphoscoliosis is not common in CCD. Scoliosis was\\nreported in 16/90 (17%) of patients with CCD, usually manifesting at a later age. Three of\\nthe affected patients in that study used a back brace, and none required surgery [Cooper et\\nal, 2001].\\nHypophosphatasia is an inborn error of bone metabolism caused by mutations in the tissue\\nnon-specific alkaline phosphatase ( TNSALP ) gene [Whyte, 1994]. Both autosomal recessive\\nand dominant forms have been described. Clinical manifestations of hypophosphatasia vary\\nby age at clinical presentation and are divided into: perinatal, childhood, adult forms, as well\\nas odontohypophosphatasia where only dental manifestations are noted. The level of serum\\nalkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity seems to be correlated with the severity of the disorder\\n[Whyte, 1994].\\nBiochemical markers used for the diagnosis of HPP include low serum alkaline phosphatase,\\nincreased phosphoethanolamine (PEA) in urine and plasma, increased inorganic plasma\\npyrophosphate (PPi) and increased pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP) in absence of vitamin B6\\nintake [Whyte 1994; Whyte 2001]. The term “severe CCD” has been used to describe\\npatients who have CCD, osteoporosis and early recurrent fractures [Quack et al., 1999], and\\nsevere parietal bone hypoplasia [Cunningham et al., 2006]. In 2002, two separate groups\\ndescribed patients who had combined features of CCD and HPP. One group found no\\nmutations in RUNX2  or TNSALP [Unger et al., 2002], while the other reported a\\nheterozygous mutation (Arg169Pro caused by nucleotide change 506G>C) in RUNX2  in a\\nmother and daughter [Morava et al., 2002]. A CCD-Like phenotype has also been reported\\nwith 8q22 deletions [Breuten et. al, 1992]. We describe herein the clinical- radiologic and\\ngenetic-metabolic findings of a child with severe CCD featuring short stature, osteoporosis\\nand progressive kyphoscoliosis. He also had Bowdler spurs, and subnormal serum alkaline\\nphosphatase levels suggestive of HPP. The underlying genetic defect was found to be a\\nmicrodeletion in the C-terminal region of RUNX2 .\\nCLINICAL REPORT\\nA 6-year-old male, with normal intellect, was referred to the skeletal dysplasia clinic\\nbecause of CCD complicated by severe progressive kyphoscoliosis. His prenatal history and\\nultrasound were normal. He is the only child, born to a young, nonconsanguineous\\nCaucasian couple. The father is 196 cm and the mother 163 cm. Delivery was by cesarean at\\n41 weeks gestation due to cephalo-pelvic disproportion. At birth, his weight was 3.65 kg,\\nlength 50.8 cm, and head circumference 35 cm.\\nHe was noted to have a soft cranium and narrow, sloping shoulders. The chest wall was not\\nsmall or deformed. He had peripheral cyanosis and mild tachypnea that resolved by hood O2\\nas well as hypoglycemia that resolved by feeding. The family history revealed that the\\nproband’s parents were healthy and a distant maternal male cousin had short stature and\\nthyroid disease.\\nThe patient had widened fontanels and relative macrocephaly. Progressive growth failure\\nbegan at 3 months of age. A full endocrine and gastrointestinal work up revealed no\\nexplanation for his growth failure.

He had recurrent otitis media, requiring grommet tube insertions, and\\ndeveloped profound hearing loss-requiring hearing aids. He also had chronic sinusitis and\\nwheezing episodes. Kyphoscoliosis was apparent before 1 year of age, requiring a back\\nbrace at the age of 3 years, with no improvement. Figure 1, demonstrates the severity of his\\nbone deformity at the age of 7 years.\\nHis past history was significant for 2 separate fractures following minor trauma: a posterior\\ncortical fracture of the distal tibia which required casting for 2 weeks and a hairline fracture\\nof the foot. He also required frenuloplasty for ankyloglossia, adenoidectomy and inguinal\\nhernia repair. He had nasalized speech which was otherwise normal. He had short trunked\\ndwarfism and was approximately 4 standard deviations (SD) below the mean for height, and\\n2 SD below the mean for weight. He had brachycephaly and frontal bossing. The anterior\\nand posterior fontanels, as well as the metopic suture were wide open. He had hypertelorism\\nand slight depression of his nasal bridge. His palate was narrow and high arched. He had\\nsupernumerary teeth, while other teeth were missing. His shoulders were narrow, sloping,\\nand could be opposed easily. The back and spine showed severe kyphoscoliosis. The chest\\nwall was asymmetrically deformed, protruding anteriorly at the upper part of the sternum.\\nThe cardiopulmonary exam was normal. The abdominal exam showed no organomegaly, the\\ngenitourinary exam was unremarkable. He had brachydactyly, with broad, proximally-\\nplaced thumbs.\\nThere was swelling at the middle inter-phalangeal joints and laxity of the joints of the\\nfingers, wrists, and elbows. There were bilateral skin dimples in the region of the mid shaft\\nof the tibiae, and pes planus. The neurological exam was essentially normal with no\\nevidence of nerve compression. The radiological findings are demonstrated in Figure 2 and\\nFigure 3 respectively, taken during the first week of life. A prominent finding was\\ngeneralized osteopenia. The skull was brachycephalic with markedly diminished ossification\\nof membranous bone, wide separation of the sutures, wormian bones and hypoplastic teeth.\\nThe clavicles were absent bilaterally and the posterior ribs were widely separated from the\\nspinal elements. There were coronal and sagittal cleft- like ossification defects in the lumbar\\nvertebrae, and kyphoscoliosis with lumbar lordosis. There was absent ossification of the\\npubic and ischial bones. The hands revealed hypoplastic metacarpals and distal phalanges of\\nthe thumbs. Both fibulae showed osteochondral projections (Bowdler spurs) at the midshaft\\nof the fibulae, but the long bones revealed no evidence of metaphyseal abnormalities. The\\npatient’s most recent pulmonary function testing was restricted by his severe kyphoscoliosis.\\nHis maximum inspiratory and expiratory pressures were low at 16% of predicted for\\nmaximum inspiratory pressure and 36% of predicted for maximum expiratory pressure.\\nBone mineral density done at the age of 7 years revealed severe demineralization of the\\nlumbar spine corresponding to a calculated z-score of −3.4 and z- score average of both\\nfemoral necks was −4.87.\\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\\nBiochemical studies revealed a serum calcium level of 9.9 mg/dl (8.7–10.5), with normal\\nalbumin and phosphorus levels.

       " \"using almost 5000 Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) clones was used to explore DNA\\ngains or losses in a peripheral blood specimen from this patient. Loss of a single BAC signal\\nwas reported at chromosome 6p12.3 (CTD-2528C1; 45,544,848-45,692bp). This deletion\\nwas confirmed and narrowed to ~70kb (45,593,804-45,643,200bp, +/ − 9kb for each nearest\\nproximal and distal flanking probes) using an oligonucleotide aCGH approach where seven\\ncontiguous oligonucleotide probes were lost.\\nThe magnitude of fluorescence lost was equivalent to a single copy deletion using either\\naCGH approach. The deletion disrupts the 3' end of the RUNX2  gene (OMIM #600211),\\nincluding an additional 25Kb of non-coding sequence past the stop codon (Fig. 4). This\\ndeletion is predicted to truncate the transcript and prevent translation of acids 327 to 521. No\\ndeletion, or alteration, was observed at 8q22, a region when deleted causes a CCD-like\\nphenotype [Brueton et al, 1992].\\nDISCUSSION\\nThe diagnosis of CCD is usually based on clinical and radiological findings [Lee and Zhou,\\n2004]. A subset of patients with CCD have radiographic and biochemical features that\\noverlap with HPP [Wyckoff et al., 2005; Morava et al., 2002; and Unger et al., 2002]. In\\ninfancy, it may be difficult to clinically differentiate between both disorders because both\\npresent with a soft cranium. RUNX2 , the gene mutated in CCD is a transcription factor that\\nregulates intra-membranous and endochondral ossification during embryonic and postnatal\\nskeletogenesis [Ducy et al., 1997]. Because the clavicles ossify embryologically by both\\nroutes, the presence of significantly hypoplastic or aplastic clavicle(s) suggest CCD [Zeng et\\nal., 2005; Huang et al., 1997]. Complete absence of the clavicle has not been reported in\\nHPP [Shohat et al., 1991]. Currently, there is no effective treatment for either disorder, but\\nfor purposes of genetic counseling and assessment of the prognosis, it is prudent to identify\\nthe underlying genetic/metabolic defect in patients with overlapping features.\\nIn this report, the proband had clinical features suggestive of CCD since birth. Unexplained\\nsevere growth failure, dentition problems, and progressive kyphoscoliosis started in infancy\\nproceeding into childhood. At the age of six years, he became a candidate for corrective\\nspinal surgery to prevent pulmonary restriction. The pulmonologist and multiple orthopedic\\nsurgeons suggested intervention to allow pulmonary expansion by either using a growing\\nrod or vertical expandable titanium rib (VEPTR). The decision to perform this surgery\\nelectively has been delayed due to concerns regarding the skeletal architecture and defective\\nbone mineralization. Absence of the clavicles, suggested a diagnosis of CCD. Quack et al\\n[1999] described a patient who had an unusual form of CCD, associated with an insertion/\\nframeshift mutation (1205–1206insC). This patient had recurrent fractures that started in\\nutero and severe osteoporosis diagnosed in adulthood. He developed severe scoliosis and\\nlordosis of the spine at a later age necessitating the implantation of a Harrington rod for\\nspinal support [Quack et al., 1999].\\nIt has been shown that Runx2  null mice ( −/−) do not form bone, and lose markers of early\\nbone differentiation including alkaline phosphatase while heterozygote Runx2  deficient mice\\n(+/−) have features of CCD with reduced alkaline phosphatase activity [Komori et al., 1997;\\nOtto et al.,1997]. Forced expression of RUNX2  in cell lines of mesenchymal origin lead to\\nupregulation of osteoblast-expressed genes such as osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase\\n[Ducy, 1999]. Mutant mice expressing a truncated Runx 2  C-protein lack a mineralized\\nskeleton and fail to transactivate the osteocalcin promoter when co expressed with either\\nBMP2  “ bone morphogenic protein 2” or TGFB  “ transforming growth factor beta”\\nresponsive [Afzal et al., 2005; Choi et al., 2001].El-Gharbawy et al.

       " \"In humans with CCD, RUNX2  mutations are detected in 65% of cases, while microdeletions\\noccur in 13% of those with normal mutation analysis [Mendoza-Londono and Lee, 2006].\\nMost deletions of RUNX2  involve only a few bases [Mundlos et al. 1995,1997; Otto et al.,\\n2002; Quack et al., 1999]. A larger deletion spanning both RUNX2  and the upstream gene\\nVEGF  “vascular endothelial growth factor” was detected in a patient with CCD and vascular\\nanomalies [Izumi et al., 2006]. Another report described a large intragenic deletion\\ninvolving exons 2–6 in a three-generation family with typical CCD features, hypoplastic\\ndistal phalanges and cone shaped epiphysis of the middle phalanges [Lee et al., 2008]. In our\\npatient, no mutations (base changes or small insertions/deletions) were detected upon\\nsequencing RUNX2 , so the possibility of a large-scale genomic change involving RUNX2\\nwas investigated using aCGH. These studies revealed a 50–70Kb deletion, which predicted a\\ndisruption of the C-terminal region of RUNX2  encompassing the coding sequence for amino\\nacids (aa) 327 to 521. SMAD 1,2,3,5 binding sites and the nuclear matrix targeting signal\\n(NMTS) regions are within the deleted region (aa 369–417 and aa 390–427, respectively;\\nwhile the RUNT domain is not. A similar mutation was described by Quack et al. [1999] in\\na patient with severe CCD. They reported an insertion/frameshift 3' of the RUNT domain,\\nwhich left the DNA binding domain intact, but without activation potential, and they\\npostulated that this alteration may result in a dominant negative effect [Quack et al. 1999].\\nWithin the constraints of the current clinical study, we cannot discriminate a dominant\\nnegative effect from haploinsufficiency. The hypophosphatasia features in our patient may\\nbe secondary to reduced osteoblast differentiation and bone formation or abnormal RUNX2 -\\nSMAD interaction. The findings in this patient emphasize the importance of defining the\\nclinical and metabolic phenotype in patients with severe disease and the need to search for\\ndeletions when sequencing of the target gene is normal. It also sheds light on the integral\\nrole of the C-terminal region of RUNX2  in human osteogenesis and osteoblast\\ndifferentiation.\\nAcknowledgments\\nThis work is supported in part by an NIH Program Project Grant HD22657\\nThe authors acknowledge the patient and his family for their kind participation in this case study.\\nREFERENCES\\nAfzal F, Pratap J, Ito K, Ito Y, Stein JL, van Wijnen AJ, Stein GS, Lian JB, Javed A.
